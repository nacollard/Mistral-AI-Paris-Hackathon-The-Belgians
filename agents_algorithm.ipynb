As StIT is a technology company based in France, this law could potentially benefit the company, especially if it is considered a startup or SME. The tax incentives, benefits, and reliefs mentioned, such as a reduction in corporate income tax and VAT rates, could positively impact StIT's financial situation. However, the article does not provide specific details on whether StIT meets the criteria for these benefits, so further investigation is needed.
